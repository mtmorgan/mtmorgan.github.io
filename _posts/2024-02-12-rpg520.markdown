This three-day workshop introduces *R* (mostly) and *Bioconductor* for
working with data. It is part of the Roswell Park graduate course
'Principles of Computational Oncology'. The course uses the University
at Buffalo CCR cluster, introducing participants to the primary
computational resource available outside personal laptops. Day 1
provides a basic introduction to *R*, *RStudio*, and packages. Day 2
walks through a couple of case studies illustrating *R* use of data
management, exploratory analysis, and visualization. Day 3 focuses on
working with scRNASeq data (at a high level -- producing an
interactive UMAP plot from pre-computed values), as well as a look at
survival analysis.
