Two recent packages focus on publication metrics related to scientific
software projects. 

The [grantpubcite][] (GitHub) package grew out of an interested in how
federally-funded scientific grants translate into publications and
citations, particularly in National Institutes of Health programs
emphasizing software development. The package uses NIH Reporter for
grant information, and iCite to summarize citations. The package can
be used to explore the relationship between level of funding and
scientific productivity, for instance, or networks of collaboration
fostered at the level of funding programs. The package served to
introduce me to basic network visualizations, and bibliometric
analysis.

The [pmcbioc][] (GitHub) package focuses on the 74,000+ papers citing
'Bioconductor' in PubMedCentral, for instance identifying common key
words and journals as proxies for areas where *Bioconductor* has
particular impact.
