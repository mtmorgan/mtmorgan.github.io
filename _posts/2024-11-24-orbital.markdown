This continues my exploration of JavaScript.

## Motivation

Smanatha Harvey says her book *[Orbital][]* tries to be a space
*pastoral*, describing the relationships of six space station
astronauts during the sixteen orbits of a single earth day. There is
no threatening destruction or steamy romance, just an encounter
between Earth and its Anthropocene exhabitants.

The frontispiece of [Orbital][] shows the orbits of the space station
during this day; it is fun to think about orbits. For instance,
daylight is not restricted to the northern hemisphere!

A *circular* orbit is a path where an object (e.g., space station)
moves around a central body (e.g., the earth) in a perfect circle. An
*equatorial* orbit is an orbit that is directly above the equator.  An
*inclined* orbit is tilted relative to the equator. The space station
has an inclined orbit, where the inclination is 51.6&deg;. This is the
angle that each orbit crosses the equator.

If the earth were stationary, the space station would always traverse
the globe along a single circumference. But the earth rotates, so each
time the space station completes an orbit, its location over the
ground has changed. The amount of change is the amount that the
earth has rotated during the space station's orbit.

The height of a satellite orbit occurs when gravitational force
pulling the satellite toward the earth is balanced by the centripetal
force caused by the speed of the satellite in orbit. Since satellite
mass is a linear term in both the gravitational and centripetal
equations, the actual mass of the satellite does not determine
orbit. The faster a satellite travels, the further from the earth its
orbit is. Perhaps surprisingly, the faster a satellite travels, the
*longer* its orbital period (because the faster speed results in
greater distance from earth, so the satellite has to travel further to
complete an orbit). Geostationary satellites are much further from the
earth (35,800 km) than the space station (in low earth orbit, about
410 km).

## Math

This answer on the Space Exploration [StackExchange][] provides basic
math required. There are three steps.

The first step is to describe movement on a sphere with an inclined orbit.

<div>
\begin{align}
x &= \cos \omega(t) \\
y &= \sin \omega(t) \cos i \\
z &= \sin \omega(t) \sin i
\end{align}
</div>

where the radius of the orbit is 1, <span>$$\omega = 2 \pi /
T$$</span> is the circumference of the sphere scaled by the orbital
period <span>$$T$$</span>, and <span>$$i$$</span> the inclination of
the orbit. <span>$$t$$</span> is the time since the start of the orbit.

The next step is to translate the three-dimensional coordinates to
two-dimensional latitude and longitude. These equations assume that
the orbit starts at longitude 0.

<div>
\begin{align}
lon &= \arctan2(y, x) \\
lat &= \arcsin(x)
\end{align}
</div>

Incorporate the rotation of the earth by subtracting the scaled
orbital period of the earth; only the longitude is influenced by the
rotating earth.

<div>
\begin{equation}
lon = \arctan2(y, x) - \omega_E(t - t_0)
\end{equation}
</div>

<span>$$\omega_E = 2 \pi / T_E$$</span> and <span>$$T_E$$</span> is
the orbital period of the earth.

We use minutes as the unit of time. The orbital period of the space
station <span>$$T$$</span>varies between 90 and 93 minutes; we'll use
92 minutes. The orbital period of the earth <span>$$T_E$$</span> is
approximately 1436 minutes (23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds). The
inclination of the space station orbit is approximately 51.6&deg;.

## Orbital

The first sketch show a flattened earth, with space station orbits
superimposed. The orbits are described by equations for <span>$$lat,
lon$$</span> from the previous section. The orbits appear offset in
space. But actually the orbits are constant, it is the earth that
rotates under the space station.  The space station dots are equally
spaced in time, but a close observation shows that they are further
apart at the largest latitudes; this is because the projection of the
spherical earth into two dimensions stretches larger latitudes more
than smaller latitudes.

The second sketch shows the rotating earth, inclined 23.5&deg;. The
space station orbit is constant, always intersecting the equator in
the middle of the image. The location of the space station is
described the the equations for <span>$$x, y, z$$</span> above. The
orbit is inclined 51.6&deg; from the equator. Space station markers
move to the right in synchrony with the rotating earth; it took me a
long time to figure out how to make this simple transformation in
p5!. The earth's radius is 6378 km, and the orbit is 400 km above the
earth. Illumination is from the front and left, as would occur
somewhere between the spring (June) solistic and summer (March)
equinox; the image of the earth, from [NASA][NASA-earth-images], is
generated from November data, so is not quite correct.

## Notes

The implementation uses [p5][]; here's the [JavaScript][]. I use
'WEBGL' mode for 3D rendering. A difference between WEBGL and P2D
rendering is the the WEBGL coordinate system has the center of the
canvas as the origin, versus the top left under P2D. Also objects in
WEBGL are are always centered at 0; locations in the canvas are
determined using operations such as `translate()` and `rotateY()` to
adjust the relative coordinate system before drawing the
object. `push()` and `pop()` are used to limit the effects of
`translate()` etc., to sepcific shapes.

This post uses MathJax for rendering mathematical equations; see this
helpful [StackOverlow][StackOverlow-MathJax] post.
