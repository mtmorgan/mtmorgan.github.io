The [rglobus][] package has *R* functions to discover [Globus][]
collections and to initiate and check the status of file and directory
transfers. Globus is, in part, a cloud-based large file transfer
service. It is used for instance in the [HuBMAP][] project and the
HuBMAPR package.

The package is partly an exercise in learning more about [OAuth][]
authentication, as well as exploring the [httr2][] package. An open
issue for me is figuring out how to update the scope of an
authenticated service.
