Mushrooms are pretty amazing. Ancient. Weird. Scary. We walked around
on a couple of days taking pictures of mushrooms. I took the
geographical locations of each photo, and used these to display a
simple scatter plot. Clicking on a point reveals the mushroom at that
location. Taking the pictures was a fun collaborative activity, and
the pictures reveal many weird and wonderful mushrooms.

This project incorporates [p5.js][] into [svelte][] using
[p5-svelte][]. It uses some things I learned with [Walk in the woods][woods].
