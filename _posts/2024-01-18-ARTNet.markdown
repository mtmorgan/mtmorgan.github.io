This [short presentation][artnet] introduces *Bioconductor*. It
outlines some of the challenges / opportunities facing the project,
including cloud computing, python interoperability, and AI. A short
section outlines my own work on data discovery using [cellxgenedp][]
and the [ontology manipulation using OLSr][OLSr].

I took a stab at trying to identify new (in the last release) relevant
packages; this was not very successful because it was (a) difficult to
winnow the new packages to relevant packages and (b) even more
difficult to assess which packages *were going to be important*. For
the later, it might be an interesting exercise to track the download
statistics of each package as it ages; this data could be obtained
from the (e.g.,
<https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/VIEWS>) file, and from
[package download statistics][downloads] without too much difficulty.

One package catching my own attention was [simona][] for semantic
similarity in bio-ontologies, by Zuguang Gu. It imports (via a Java
library) diverse ontology formats, computes many similarity metrics,
and incldues visualization functions for both small and large
ontologies. Definitely worth checking out further.

Writing the slides, I revisted the [talk and short course
material][XM2023] and [slides][XM2023-slides] produced for XM2023, the
Brazilian Association for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I
also revisited the one-page '[cheat sheet][]' for a 2-hour workshop /
introduction from several years ago; the cheat sheet approach seems
pretty interesting for this sort of short hands-on introduction.
