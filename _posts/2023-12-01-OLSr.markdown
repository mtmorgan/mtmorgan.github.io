[OLSr][] (GitHub) provides *R* access to the EMBL-EBI [Ontology Lookup
Service][OLS]. Probably a more effective contribution would have
provided improvements to the [rols][] *Bioconductor* package, but I
wanted to explore a 'tibble' representation (rather than the more
formal S4 classes used by *rols*) emphasizing local caching and
memoization to enhance performance and robustness of RESTful client
implementations.
