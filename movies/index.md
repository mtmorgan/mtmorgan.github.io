### General reflections

Viewing these has helped to develop criteria for evaluating movies. The movies
at the top of the list combine pillars of compeling themes, excellent acting,
unique cinematography, and a strong directorial presence. Movies further down
the list seem generally to compromise one (or more) of these pillars, and then further down still to develop individual components less fully.

### Themes

The future: *Mad Max: Fury Road*, *Children of Men*, *Her*, *Wall-E*.

Social commentary: *Parasite*, *The Departed*, *Bridesmaids*.

Relationship: *In The Mood for Love*, *Phantom Thread*, *Anatomy of a Fall*.

Personal growth: *Am√©lie*, *Lady Bird*, *Frances Ha*, *Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon*, *Spirited Away*, *The Royal Tenenbaums*, *Superbad*.

Groundhog day: *Mulholland Drive*, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*.
