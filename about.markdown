# Major accomplishments

I led the [Bioconductor][] project (2009-2021) for the statistical
analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
analysis. *Bioconductor* is an open-source, open-development project
with contributions from 1000's of academic and other researchers
across the globe. It is widely used (more than 1M unique IP downloads
annually) and highly impactful (more than 75000 'PubMedCentral'
citations in the scientific literature). I obtained major (US) federal
and other funding, coordinated global project direction and vision,
and formalized project leadership structure. I oversaw the project's
internet presence and computational resources, and contributed key
'infrastructure' packages for parallel computing and domain specific
analysis.

Earlier in my career, I made significant technical contributions to
understanding the evolutionary role of genome-wide 'deleterious
mutation', including its role in patterning neutral molecular
variation, generating inbreeding depression, and the selection and
evolution of self-fertilization, migration, and life history.

During my gradate training, I developed understanding of selection on
plant reproductive morphologies using quantitative genetic and
'evolutionary stable strategy' models coupled with statistical tools
for the inference of paternal reproductive success.
